# Code Reviews as a culture
#### Someone
## My computer died :(
* These notes are from my memory...
  * Don't expect much
## What makes good culture
* Clearly defined culture that is well documented and understood by everyone
## What doesn't make good culture
* When there are only a few people that "make" the culture but no one really knows how they do it
  * What happens when they leave?
    * Culture leaves with them
## What does this have to do with code reviews?
* Wasn't really well explained...
* Use "teaching" comments on pull requests instead of "demanding" ones
  * Try to be encouraging instead of discouraging
* Pull requests are meant to be a place for discussion, but it must also be productive
