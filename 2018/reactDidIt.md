# React Already Did That/DOJO sales pitch
#### Dylan S

## This guy works for dojo
* Dojo inveneted modern js????
    * I don't believe that
* This guy worked on Dojo...
    * Might be _slightly_ biased
* He's pushing dojo pretty hard
    * I think he might work for DOJO
        * Something tells me that...
* He's referring to Dojo as "we" now
    * I think he might actually be dojo
> I'm going to be focused on Dojo as long as a single person cares
## Challeneges with React
* Too much choice/customizability
* You need to keep up with effeciency packages yourself
## Typing
* Flow & typescript are still relevant
* Typescript is getting more traction still
## Other Frameworks
> When you have to choose frameworks as often as you have to change popular music, that isn't good for anyone
* vue
* svelte
    * very lightweight
* ionic
* project evergreen
    * Just support newest browsers only
## TC39
* doing more extendable stuff with the native language
## "Real world"
* Performance of modern js frameworks
## The react approach is not going away
* But react probably will
# How many times has he said dojo?
* probably at least 30 at this point
