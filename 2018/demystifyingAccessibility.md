# Demystifying Accessibility

## Different users have different preferences
* different devices, use cases, etc.
## How to observe your users
* their study was with blind students
* > describe what you see
    * maybe not appropriate
* all of the student (examples) had different methods of interacting with their devices
> there should be parity between the sighted experience and the screen reader experience
* people don't fit into a single bucket
## Inclusive Design
* not about people with disabilities
    * should be for everyone
## How can this apply to UI components?
> when you have something that's already built it's hard to make it accessable.  It's much easier to think about accessibility from the start
* Navigation using keyboard shortcuts
    * People dont always navigate linearly
    * HTML tag names are important
        * Make sure they are the correct type for page structure
* Don't label links with ambiguous names
    * ex. "click here"
* Using headers as an outline of the page is important
    * Make sure header names are meaningful too
* Order of contents is important
    * Card sorting technique
        * have students order different sections of page content using note cards
## Page Layouts
* previous and next buttons should be available as soon as possible
* comments should be hidden by default
* Put the most used UI elements closer to the top of the page
