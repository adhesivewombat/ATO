# [Using Content Strategy to Improve OSS Documentation](bit.ly/contentandoss)
#### Stephanie Morillo - Microsoft

## Coomunity is lacking documentation
* github did a survey
    * 93% say good documentation is the #1 thing they like to see in a project
    * 60% say they don't do documentation
* technical writing is hard
* there are a lot of types of documentation
## What is content strategy
* The planning for creation and delivery of useful product and governance
* content = documentation (in this presentation)
## Types of documentation
* process documents
    * what does it do?
    * codes of conduct
    * license
    * etc.
* end user documentation
    * how to I use
    * api docs
    * function docs
    * etc.
## How to use Content Strategy
* Create a standard for _where_ all documentation should go
* Create a "content inventory"
    * what is documented
    * where is it
    * what's the title
    * last updated
* perform a "content audit"
    * using the inventory, figure out where the holes are
* host the docs on an external site
    * also put it in your repo
        * probably create the site from the repo docs
    * easier to navigate and view
    * can use analytics on the site
        * useful for priorizing updates on the docs
    * can encourage more traffic for public docs
* Good titles are important
    * ex. "How to use X to do Y"
* Write the documenation while you're doing the work
    * can format it later
* put contribution guidelines in its own file
* include a document on how to set up a dev env
* Add links on the doc site to the doc repo
    * even ask them to edit it there
## Check in with your users
* send out a survey
    * figure out what your users can get the most use out of
* ask for feedback directly
## Templates
* documentation templates save tons of time
* keeps things consistent
* helpful for new contributors
## Use peer reviews
* check for sepelllinng
* check for technical accuracy
* suggestions for clear-er language
## Examples of well documented projects
* django
* webpack
* vuejs
* rspec
* ruby on rails
