# [Using Content Strategy to Improve OSS Documentation](bit.ly/contentandoss)
#### Stephanie Morillo - Microsoft

## Community is lacking documentation
* Github did a survey
    * 93% say good documentation is the #1 thing they like to see in a project
    * 60% say they don't do documentation
* Technical writing is hard
* There are a lot of types of documentation
## What is content strategy
* The planning for creation and delivery of useful product and governance
* Content = documentation (in this presentation)
## Types of documentation
* Process documents
    * What does it do?
    * Codes of conduct
    * License
    * Etc.
* End user documentation
    * How to I use
    * Api docs
    * Function docs
    * Etc.
## How to use Content Strategy
* Create a standard for _where_ all documentation should go
* Create a "content inventory"
    * What is documented
    * Where is it
    * What's the title
    * Last updated
* Perform a "content audit"
    * Using the inventory, figure out where the holes are
* Host the docs on an external site
    * Also put it in your repo
        * Probably create the site from the repo docs
    * Easier to navigate and view
    * Can use analytics on the site
        * Useful for priorizing updates on the docs
    * Can encourage more traffic for public docs
* Good titles are important
    * Ex. "How to use X to do Y"
* Write the documenation while you're doing the work
    * Can format it later
* Put contribution guidelines in its own file
* Include a document on how to set up a dev env
* Add links on the doc site to the doc repo
    * Even ask them to edit it there
## Check in with your users
* Send out a survey
    * Figure out what your users can get the most use out of
* Ask for feedback directly
## Templates
* Documentation templates save tons of time
* Keeps things consistent
* Helpful for new contributors
## Use peer reviews
* Check for sepelllinng
* Check for technical accuracy
* Suggestions for clear-er language
## Examples of well documented projects
* Django
* Webpack
* Vuejs
* Rspec
* Ruby on rails
