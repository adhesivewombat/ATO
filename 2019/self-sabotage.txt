How Developers Self Sabotage their learning and what to do instead - 101 (Tori Hall)
	
Focus

* is multitasking a thing?
	* no, not really
* focus is key
	* duh
		* but it's hard sometimes
	* checking emails at conferences is SABOTAGE
	* tips
		* take breaks
			* trainers should give you breaks (but ask if they don't)
		* set goals
		* be intentional about which talks you go to
		
Contact Mindset

* not meeting people at conferences is SABOTAGE
	* don't just talk to the people that you already know
	* tech is a team sport
		* problems usually don't get solved by an individual
		* the more people you know working in the same tech, the more people you have to bounce ideas off of
	* diversity is good
	* talk to people at the booths
	* talk to the presenter
	
Discussion

* Hammer & Nail (problem or solution)
	* Which is more important?
		* my answer (SABOTAGE): the nail
		* real answer: the hammer!
	* why?
		* tech moves really fast
		* today's problem isn't going to be relevant for very long
		* solutions have a lot more staying power
		* problems shift a lot faster
* Questions
	* ask questions to learn
		* don't ask questions to teach other people in the room
	* find applications to current problems
		* don't focus entirely on current problems
	* have an open mind
		* don't learn to doubt
		* though it does pay to be skeptical sometimes
	
Q&A

* how do I throw myself into something new?
	* have a friend that knows the new thing better than you (or someone at your same level)
	* talk to your friend about your problems with the thing
* problem vs solution
	* someone disagrees that problems don't last a long time
	* sometimes in looking for solutions you will learn new things?
	* this topic seems polarizing
	* probably should focus on both
		* harnd to find a solution without a problem
