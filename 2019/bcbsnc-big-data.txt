Blue Cross Same Day Data Experiments - Big Data (Glenn Bernstein, BCBSNC)
	Hurry up and wait - our journey to smae day experiments and big data super powers

* BCBS started with paper and now has competition with other in the virtual space (google, amazon, walmart)
* NC - 4 million members, 5k employees
* federal government is pushing BCBSNC to make data avialable via open standards and open resources
	* FHIR
	* need to be dealing with providers in standardized data sets
	* the patient information needs to be at the doctors office real time
	* standardized data quality
	* needs to be responsible with the data
		* health data is sensitive
* BCBS started by pushing for standardizing insurance claim forms
* Doctors offices don't share information between themselves
	* difficult for patients
* dataathepointofcare.gov

Solution

* cloud based system
* many different techs
* sources -> storange & analytics -> external consumers

Journey

* They started in a pretty bad scenerio, nothing was really accessable via APIs or anything
* Came up with the idea of making a datalake
	* pretty standard design - hadoop, tons of storage, jupyter notebook, r server, etc.
	* on AWS
* Why a data lake?
	* data needs to be real-time
	* allows for retrieving and using data quickly
* Getting access to data was a big blocker
* Pains with the "legacy" datalake
	* fixed size cluster
	* even on the cloud it took a long time to scale up
	* hard to make configuration changes
	* (they weren't leveraging modern AWS solutions)
	* sercurity and HIPPA compliance is difficult on the cloud
		* all medical data needs to be encrypted end-to-end
		* SSL missing on RDBMS systems

Next iteration Goals

* they wanted to own all of it
	* no managed services
	* not relying on a vendor for changes
* quickly adaptable
	* market changes quickly
	* not sure what the data will look like in a few years
	* extensible
* prototype-friendly
	* easy to play with the data
* repeatable
	* easy to stand up copies of an environment

Next iteration solutions (platform 2.0)

* Open source software
	* hadoop, spark, git, jenkins, ansible, docker, k8s
* infrastructure as code
	* build a pipeline
	* deploy as code
* Data governance
	* Collibra was picked
	* ODPi - standards to use data across all platforms
* Data as a supply chain
	* lots of sources of data and lots of different kind of data
* Dev-ops
	* use of multiple AWS environments
		* sandboxes
		* specific environments for internal purposes (analytics, testing, development, etc.)
		* multiple pdocution environments
			* production-discovery environemnt
				* it's a production env where people develop
			* production-automation environment
				* actual production
			* production-integration
				* used for automation testing
* security
	* cell level encryption and security
* they are now building a platform portal
	* self service
	* data journey
