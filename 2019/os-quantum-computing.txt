OS Quantum computing - 101 (Sean Dague, IMB Q)

Super Basics

* q-bits, quantum superposition
* can only measure as a 1 or 0 (breakdown of wave function)
	* sometimes has a probability of being biased to 0 or 1
* uses quantum entaglement
	* instead of using classical and/or/not gates, there are entagled states
* algorithms use the concept of constructive/desrtuctive interference to determine answers to problems

What is quantum computing good for?

* simulating quantum mechanics
* ML
* a lot of te times worse than classical computing
* we don't know really what it's super useful for yet (apart from some specific problems)
	* it has been opened up to the public to find questions

Qiskit

* python
* open source
* built on Terra, Ignis, Aqua, Aer
* not actually running on quantum hardware, just a simulation of it
	* unless you use the link at the top
* goes down to pretty basic hardware simulation
	* results of qbit state measurements
	* entangling

Real quantum devices

* anyone can run code on a quantum computer right now
* quantum-computing.ibm.com
* (runs qiskit)
* 14 qubit
	* general purpose
*
